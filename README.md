# Abstract
Body size is a salient functional trait in bees, with implications for reproductive fitness, pollination ecology, and responses to environmental change. Methods for quantifying bee body size commonly rely on indirect estimates and vary widely across studies, particularly in studies of the large carpenter bees (Xylocopa Latreille, 1802). We evaluate the robustness of three common body size parameters (intertegular distance, head width, and costal vein length) as predictors of dry body mass within and between 11 Xylocopa species (and 5 subspecies). We find that all three size measurements provide robust body size estimates, accounting for 92-93% of intraspecific variation in body mass. Within species, however, these measurements were considerably less predictive of body mass, explaining on average only 36.8% (intertegular distance), 57.4% (head width), and 38.8% (costal vein length) Â of the variation in body mass. We also highlight a novel application of photogrammetry and 3D modeling to estimate surface area and volume across species, and comment on the utility of these methods for body size estimates in the Xylocopa and in insects more broadly. These findings provide practical guidelines for body size estimation methods within and between carpenter bee species.

### Code: Contains code for data analysis in R
Xylocopa_morphometrics_analysis.R: In this document, we analyze morphometric data (ITD, head width, costal vein length, dry mass, volume, surface area) to understand inter- and intra-specific predictors of body size.

## Data: Contains the raw morphometric and specimen data in two formats
Xylocopa_morphometrics.csv: In this document, we present the raw morphometric and specimen data used in the analysis (Xylocopa_morphometrics_analysis.R).
Xylocopa_Morphometrics_trait_format.csv: In this document, we present the same raw data as above, but in a standardized format that lends itself to functional trait data sharing (see this [functional trait data sharing repository](https://github.com/mostwald/Functional-trait-review) for descriptors of column headers).
